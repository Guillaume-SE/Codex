# What's Codex ?

Codex is a site where I list the things I've read, seen and played, to which I give a rating.
This can be series, films, video games and books.
It also allows me to keep up to date with the ones I've planned to see, the ones I've left out and my favorites.

## Functionalities

- Manage and curate a taxonomy of medias (books, movies, series, video games).
- Cascade deletion of the cover file when the related media is deleted.
- Handles storing user-uploaded cover images with automatic resize ([Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/)).
- Details page for each media, retrieved by media id.

## Database diagram and relationship explanations  

![diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a71f22b9-907c-45ac-b73e-d1036bfbff8b)



- `users`: As the project aims to contain only my media entries, I chose not to link the "users" table to "reviews". It will only be used for authentication.

- `media`: Will contain every type of data the media I add may have, for example books, video games, movies and series all have a synopsis.  
  The media category (book, game, movies...) will determine how the rest of the information is added to a dedicated table.

- `media_statuses`: A status to categorize each media item as Planned, Completed, Waiting, Paused, Abandoned for example.

- `media_categories`: Contains media categories (Movie for example) for filtering media.

- `media_types`: Contains a sub-category to filter media more precisely within the same category. They are linked to a media category, allowing duplication and facilitating filter management.

- `reviews`: A review is linked to a media and cannot exist without its associated media, but not all media have a review.

- `covers`: Each media is associated with an official cover that easily identifies it. If an official cover has not been found on the internet (or in poor quality), a default cover is automatically assigned.

- `movies_infos`: contains all media-specific information relating to the films.

- `games_infos`: contains all media information related to video games.

- `series_infos`: contains all the information related to series.

- `anime_infos`: contains all the information related to animÃ©, mainly japanese animation.

- `books_infos`: contains all book-related media information.

- `media_contributors`: people or companies involved in the creation of a media and the role they played in it.

- `genres`: media genre (fantasy, action, comedy...) linked to a media category, allowing duplication and facilitating filter management.

## Future plans

- Restrict access to certain pages and functions to non-administrator users.
- Search medias by title and a number of filters (genre, rating, name, etc).
- Statistical display of media distribution according to various criteria.
- Setting up a front end with Vue.js.

## How to start

Node version > 18.18  
AdonisJS v5

Set up the database informations in the `.env` like the `.env.example`. The project use a MySQL database.

```bash
# clone the project
git clone https://github.com/Guillaume-SE/Codex.git

# install dependencies
npm install

# run the project
npm run dev

# create the database
node ace migration:run
```

## Status
26/07/24: Version 2 of the database is complete, I'm updating the code to incorporate this v2!  

## Other

The project is still under development, so I'll add more information as it becomes available :sunglasses:
