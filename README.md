## What's Codex ?

Codex is a site where I list the things I've read, seen and played, to which I give a rating.
This can be series, films, video games and books.
It also allows me to keep up to date with the ones I've planned to see, the ones I've left out and my favorites.

### Functionalities

- Manage and curate a taxonomy of medias (books, movies, series, video games).
- Cascade deletion of the cover file when the related media is deleted.
- Handles storing user-uploaded cover images with automatic resize ([Sharp](https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/)).
- Details page for each media, retrieved by media id.

### Future plans

- Restrict access to certain pages and functions to non-administrator users.
- Search medias by title and a number of filters (genre, rating, name, etc).
- Statistical display of media distribution according to various criteria.
- Setting up a front end with Vue.js.
